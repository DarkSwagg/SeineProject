# Seine Project

by **Mahlia Merville**

For the project in collaboration with **Paul Mazas** and **Professor Soohyun Yang**

## libraries

The needed libraries are the following:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
import sys
from scipy.stats import pearsonr
import matplotlib as mpl
import mpltern
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

## Datasets Instructions

All the datasets are to be found on NAS, an online storage server. You should download the following files: biol_data, phychem_data and Qgis.

You should then place the files in the current repository, without pushing them on GitHub (they are too heavy).

The construction of the whole repository should be as follows.

## biol_data

Contains biological raw and processed data

## phychem_data

Contains physico-chemical raw and processed data

## python_codes

Contains all python codes used in the project

## Qgis

Contains files useful for Qgis

## results_figures

Saved figure and plots
